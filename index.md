Overview
================================================================================
This document is divided into several sections. Please navigate to the ones you
are interested in.

*Note* that if you want to follow updates to this page, you can Star the
[project](https://github.com/philsc/frc971-programming-intro) while logged into
GitHub.  You'll then receive e-mail notifications of updates to the page.

Logistics
================================================================================

### SVN Account
Signup page: <http://boardsailor.com/passwordFRC.html>

Michael Schuh will need to manually create an account for you so please be
patient after you fill out the form on that page. You'll receive an e-mail once
your account is created. Then you can log in to the SVN repo and the gerrit
repo below.

### Gerrit Account
Once you have an SVN account, please log into
[gerrit](https://robotics.mvla.net/gerrit/#/) and e-mail Brian that you would
like access to the robot code. This repo contains all of 971's code. The robot
code and our scouting code.

Make sure that you can also access the [training
repo](https://robotics.mvla.net/gerrit/#/admin/projects/training).

### Git Practice
Creating an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a great way to get
started with using git. This will let you practice version control. They also
have a [desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/) if you don't want to jump
into using the command line right away.

### Google Group
Please apply to our [971 Programmers Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/frcteam971programmers). There
you can post questions and have people from 971 help you.

Of course, you can post questions and such on other forums too if you prefer
that.

Getting Started
================================================================================

### IDE
The easiest way to get started is to install an Integrated Development
Envrironment (a.k.a IDE). In general an IDE lets you write code, compile it,
and run it all in one package. For starting with C++, I would recomment
[Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/). It's pretty easy to get started
with it and there are quite a few
[tutorials](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/introduction/codeblocks/) out
there. Just search for them.

*Note:* If you're downloading the Windows version make sure to select the MinGW
version. Otherwise you will likely not be able to compile your programs.

### Git
For some introduction on what you can do with git and what it can do for you,
please watch the [introductory videos](https://git-scm.com/videos).

Tasks
================================================================================
You should be able to complete most of these tasks without programming a
Graphical User Interface (a.k.a a GUI). These can be coded up as "console
applications". The idea is to just print words on the screen.

*NOTE:* Please compile your code as
[C++11](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18174988/how-can-i-add-c11-support-to-codeblocks-compiler)
(i.e.  the 2011 version of C++).  The vast majority of the examples I give will
not compile if you use an older version of C++.

### Fizz Buzz
A classic little puzzle meant to acquaint people with new programming
languages. The challenge is to print out the numbers 1 through 100 on separate
lines. However, if that number is evenly divisible by 3 print the word "Fizz"
instead of that number. When the number is evenly divisible by 5 print the word
"Buzz" instead. If the number is evenly divisible by 3 _and_ 5 then print "Fizz
Buzz" instead.

Here's a piece of code to get you guys started:

{% highlight C++ %}
{% include code/fizz_buzz.cc %}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Bonus
Split your code into separate files so that you can write a test function in a
separate file altogether. For example, if your `fizz_buzz_modular.cc` looks
something like the following:

{% highlight C++ %}
{% include code/fizz_buzz_modular.cc %}
{% endhighlight %}

and your `fizz_buzz_modular.h` looks like:

{% highlight C++ %}
{% include code/fizz_buzz_modular.h %}
{% endhighlight %}

then write a `fizz_buzz_test.cc` that makes sure that given the number 18518505
the function returns "Fizz Buzz".  In the end we expect you to have 4 files: 1
header file, one fizz-buzz implementation, one that iterates over numbers 1
through 100, and one that tests your code.

Download the [sample Code::Blocks
project](https://github.com/philsc/frc971-programming-intro/tree/master/samples/FizzBuzz)
if you're stuck on how to do this. You can also download a [zip
file](https://github.com/philsc/frc971-programming-intro/archive/master.zip)
and look at the `samples/FizzBuzz` folder.

The key is to create separate Build Targets to compile the main application
versus the test application.

### Number Guessing Game
The challenge is to get the computer to generate a random number between 1 and
100 inclusive. Then the player has to guess what the number is. The computer
reads the player's guess and informs the player whether the guess was correct,
too low, or too high. The player then gets another guess if the previous one
was incorrect. Give the player 6 guesses in total.

Here's a piece of code to get you started:

{% highlight C++ %}
{% include code/number_guessing.cc %}
{% endhighlight %}

This is a great opportunity to learn about how to use Google. Figure out how
you gather user input using C++.

_Update_: Some people have pointed out that the example above just generates
the same number every time. I'll look into it. If you figure out what's wrong,
let us know!

#### Bonus
Similar to what you did for Fizz Buzz split your code into separate files so
that you can write a stand-alone test file. Write a function that generates a
random number between 1 and 100 and use that in your number guessing game. Then
write a test that runs your random number generating function 10'000 times and
makes sure that the number is between 1 and 100.

### Maze Walking
The challenge is to provide the player with a maze that they can navigate.

Start with a simple piece of code that prints a simple 5 by 5 map:

{% highlight C++ %}
{% include code/maze_walking_start.cc %}
{% endhighlight %}

Add a `kPlayer` cell type similar to `kWall` and `kOpen`. Make the player start
at one `kOpen` spot. Move the `kPlayer` cell around As the player gives you
input. The player wins when he reaches another `kOpen` spot that you've
designated. The player cannot move into or through `kWall` spots.

#### Bonus
Generate a solvable maze in the style of the Maze Walking code. There are many
ways to do this, but with a 5x5 maze, trial and error is not a bad way. If you
go the route of trial and error, make sure you have a way to check if a maze is
valid.


### Blackjack
The challenge is to create a single player blackjack game. There should be a
dealer and a player. To start you off, we've provided a basic class outline for
a deck of cards.

{% highlight C++ %}
{% include code/blackjack.cc %}
{% endhighlight %}

Start by filling in the class to represent a deck, then use that to store the
state of the cards. In the outline, we've included an empty class that you
should fill in. Once your deck and hand are functional, write a game with the
dealer and a player, and let players hit and stay. The main function and game
should be in a separate file.
